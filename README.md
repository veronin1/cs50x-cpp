# CS50x C++ Translations

This repo contains my translations of CS50x C projects into C++. The goal is to rewrite the assignments using C++ features like classes and STL where it makes sense, while keeping the original logic intact.

## Structure

- `week1/`, `week2/`, etc. â€” folders with projects grouped by week
- Each folder contains `.cpp` files for translated assignments
- Optional `utils/` folder for shared helper code

## How to build and run

Compile with any C++ compiler. For example:

```sh
g++ week1/mario-less.cpp -o mario-less
./mario-less
```
